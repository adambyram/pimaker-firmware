#Marlin firmware for PiMaker
This is the Marlin_v1 branch of the Solidoodle 2/3 firmware from https://github.com/mlaws/solidoodle2 modified with the configurion needed to drive a PiMaker 3D Printer (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:128700) running on a Printrboard Rev D.  Please note - a polar conversion program (listed at the Thingiverse link) needs to be run against your gcode *before* sending it to this firmware.


##Step 1

You need to have the Arduino0022 IDE installed. If you have a later version, you'll need to downgrade.
Download from:
-http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software

###PC Users:

A version of Arduino022 already setup for this firmware is now available again at: http://www.mediafire.com/?3qy0wjf86a66du8 .

A version of Arduino 1.03 already setup for this firmware is now available at: .

Simply unzip into a folder of your choice.

Skip to step 4.

##Step 2 (Mac only)

Clone the repository at
-https://github.com/jmgiacalone/sanguino1284p
and copy the included Sanguino directory to the hardware directory of your Arduino install. On Mac OS X, that would be ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware.


##Step 3 (Mac only)

Close the Arduino IDE and then copy the file avrdude.conf from the sanguino1284p clone to your ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/tools/avr/etc.
Start the Arduino IDE and you should now see 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' AND 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' options in the Tools->Board menu.

##Step 4

If you have a Solidoodle 2, then the firmware is already setup for you by default.
If you have a Solidodle 3, simply change line 15 in configuration.h from:
```C
#define SOLIDOODLE_VERSION 2
```
to:
```C
#define SOLIDOODLE_VERSION 3 
```

##Step 5

For the standard Solidoodle 2/3 model with the 644P microcontroller, upload the firmware as is and select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' option.

##Step 6

If you're adding an SDSL SDCARD reader, or Panelolu LCD display and rotary encoder with SDSL, you will need to select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' board. Please purchase a 1284P with a bootloader already in place.

For a Panelolu/SD card reader combo, uncomment line 316 in configuration.h from:
```C
//#define ULTIPANEL  //the ultipanel as on thingiverse
```
to:
```C
#define ULTIPANEL  //the ultipanel as on thingiverse
```
Now compile and upload.

If you're only adding SDSL, uncomment line 313 in configuration.h from:

```C
//#define SDSUPPORT // Enable SD Card Support in Hardware Console
```
to:
```C
#define SDSUPPORT // Enable SD Card Support in Hardware Console
```

Now compile and upload.
